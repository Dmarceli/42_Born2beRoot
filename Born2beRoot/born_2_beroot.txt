Make sure your user it's called "YOUR USERNAME" followed by 42 
ex: bmiguel-42, dmarceli42

install done;

- run the command su
- run:  apt update     and      apt upgrade
- Install Sudo : apt install sudo
-Add our user to sudo group : sudo usermod -aG sudo bmiguel-

 -a is a shortcut for --append: It means append the group to the list of groups the user belongs to!

 -G is a shortcut for --groups: It tells usermod that the next 
 argument is a group. Note that you need to use a capital -G here 
 because we don’t want to modify the user’s primary group but the list 
 of supplemental groups the user belongs to.

- Go back to your user: su - bmiguel-
- Add group user42: sudo groupadd user42
- Add our user to the new group: sudo usermod -aG user42 bmiguel-
- Install VIM: sudo apt install vim
- Install OpenSSH: sudo apt install openssh-server
- Verify ssh service: sudo systemctl status ssh
- Get the both IP's: ip a
- ADD port 4242: Go to etc/ssh/sshd_config, and edit the #Port22 to Port 4242 with sudo vim sshd_config
- Install Firewall UFM: sudo apt install ufw
- Active UFW: sudo ufw enable
- Check if its enable: sudo ufw status
- Add 4242 port on VirtualBox
- Reboot machine: sudo reboot
- Firewall allow ssh port: sudo ufw allow 4242/tcp
- Add remote ssh to VM: sudo ssh -p 4242 username@ip_adress
- Add remote ssh to your machine: sudo ssh-p 4242@username@ip_adress
- Check sudo ss -tunlp, and check if you have 68 port open, check the pid and the 
fd because they change, ex: pid 544 fd 9, if you have 
that port open jut run the command sudo kill -9 544

Password policy

- run sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
- go to etc, run sudo vim login.defs and search for 
PASS_MAX_DAYS  9999
PASS_MIN_DAYS   0
PASS_WARN_AGE   7

and change to 

PASS_MAX_DAYS   30
PASS_MIN_DAYS   2
PASS_WARN_AGE   7


- go to /etc/pam.d and run sudo vim common-password, find
password        requisite                       pam_pwquality.so retry=3

and add lcredit=-1 (for 1 lower case letter minimum) ucredit=-1 (for 1 Upper case letter minimum) 
dcredit=-1 (for at least 1 digit) maxrepeat=3 (the maximum number of times a single 
character may be repeated) usercheck=0 (user can't be on pw) difok=7 
(the minimum number of characters that must be different from the old password) 
enforce_for_root (to enforce the rules to root) 

SUDO GROUP

go to /etc/sudoers, NEVER EDIT the sudoers file with a NORMAL TEXT EDITOR
ALWAYS USE VISUDO COMMAND FOR THAT PORPUSE 

ru: sudo visudo

in the Defaults section add:
Defaults        requiretty (to enable tty mode)
Defaults        logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log" (folder where log file will be saved)
Defaults        log_input, log_output (save input and output)
Defaults        passwdtries=3 (password retires, usually it comes predefine, but still put it)
Defaults        badpass_message="Take a stress pill and think things over" (costume error message in case password error)

the security pass probably comes already wrote but in case it doesnt here it is:

Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
