install done;

- BEFORE something run: sudo apt update     and      sudo apt upgrade
- Install Sudo : apt install sudo
-Add our user to sudo group : sudo usermod -aG sudo bmiguel-42

 -a is a shortcut for --append: It means append the group to the list of groups the user belongs to!

 -G is a shortcut for --groups: It tells usermod that the next argument is a group. Note that you need to use a capital -G here because we don’t want to modify the user’s primary group but the list of supplemental groups the user belongs to.
