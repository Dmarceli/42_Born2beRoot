<h3> What is a virutal Machine</h3>
<p> A virtual machine is a program on a computer that works like it is a separate computer inside the main computer. ... It is a simple way to run more than one operating system on the same computer. A very powerful server can be split into several smaller virtual machines to use its resources better.</p>
<h3> Why you choose Debian/CentOs</h3>
<p> This is on you!</p>

<h3> The purpose of virtual machines</h3>
<p> The main purpose of VMs is to operate multiple operating systems at the same time, from the same piece of hardware. Without virtualization, operating multiple systems — like Windows and Linux — would require two separate physical units.</p>
<h3> The difference between aptitude and apt</h3>
<p> Apt-get being a lower level package manager is restricted only to command line, while Aptitude being a higher-level tool has a default text-only interactive interface along with option of command-line operation by entering required commands.</p>
<h3> What APPArmor is</h3>
<p> is a Linux kernel security module that allows the system administrator to restrict programs' capabilities with per-program profiles. Profiles can allow capabilities like network access, raw socket access, and the permission to read, write, or execute files on matching paths.</p>
<h3> What SSH is and the value of using it</h3>
<p> SSH provides password or public-key based authentication and encrypts connections between two network endpoints. ... In addition to providing strong encryption, SSH is widely used by network administrators to manage systems and applications remotely, deliver software patches, or execute commands and move files.</p>
<h3> What is cron</h3>
<p> Cron is a standard Unix utility that is used to schedule commands for automatic execution at specific intervals. For instance, you might have a script that produces web statistics that you want to run once a day automatically at 5:00 AM.</p>
<h3> The commands you have to know</h3>
<p> If you've done the project, and read the guide and did'nt copy paste, you will know the commands for sure, just check the guide below what the evaluation will be! This is all for me, I wish you good luck!!!!
